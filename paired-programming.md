## Goal of the project
- The goal of the project seems clear (simulating F1 hybrid genomes) and has an appropriate plan. It may help to automatically include pandas and matplotlib as dependencies to simplify the decision-making for the user. But otherwise, this is straightforward and clear.


## The data
- The required input data files are well-explained, and the resulting output options are also given. It reads as though there will always be three output files (VCF, CSV, and plots) and one optional stats file. It may be useful to give the user the option of specifying which output files they want (i.e., one is necessary, but all are optional) for more customization.

## The code
- The current code/pseudocode in `distortopia/segdistorters.py` and `distortopia/simf1poly.py` could use more comments do lay out what the functions are doing and how they fit into the overall picture.
